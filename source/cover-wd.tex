\textbf{\Huge
Mandating the Standard Library:\\Clause 22 - Iterators library}
\end{center}

With the adoption of P0788R3, we have a new way of specifying requirements for the
library clauses of the standard. This is one of a series of papers reformulating the
requirements into the new format. This effort was strongly influenced by the informational
paper P1369R0.

The changes in this series of papers fall into four broad categories.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Change "participate in overload resolution" wording into "Constraints" elements}
\item{Change "Requires" elements into either "Mandates" or "Expects", depending (mostly) on whether or not they can be checked at compile time.}
\item{Drive-by fixes (hopefully very few)}
\end{itemize}

This paper covers Clause 22 (Iterators). Because the iterator requirements have been recently re-worked to use concepts (as part of the adoption of Ranges), large portions of this clause required few (or no) changes.

As a drive-by fix, I have removed a bunch of empty descriptions of the form: "Effects: Constructs an object of class \tcode{Foo}."

The entire clause is reproduced here, but the changes are confined to a few sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item{iterator.iterators        \ref{iterator.iterators}}
\item{bidirectional.iterators   \ref{bidirectional.iterators}}
\item{random.access.iterators   \ref{random.access.iterators}}
\item{move.iter.cons            \ref{move.iter.cons}}
\item{istream.iterator.cons     \ref{istream.iterator.cons}}
\item{istream.iterator.ops      \ref{istream.iterator.ops}}
\item{ostream.iterator.cons.des \ref{ostream.iterator.cons.des}}
\item{ostreambuf.iter.cons      \ref{ostreambuf.iter.cons}}
\end{itemize}
